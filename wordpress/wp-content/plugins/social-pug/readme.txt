== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What social sharing buttons are supported? =

We currently support Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest and LinkedIn as social sharing buttons in the free version. The Pro version adds many more social media networks for both social sharing and social follow.

= Can I activate tweet count for my Twitter social sharing button? =

Twitter has officially removed support for the tweet count of a URL. Luckily a third party application, namely OpenShareCount, has come to provide an alternative solution. Social Pug has partnered with OpenShareCount to provide social sharing proof for your Twitter social sharing button.

= Can I customize the social information that is being shared on social media? =

By default Social Pug will use the post's title and featured image to populate what is being shared on the social platforms. If you wish to have full control on what gets shared when a visitor uses the social sharing buttons, please visit our website and check out Social Pug premium.

= Will your social sharing plugin slow down my website? =

No. Social Pug is a lightweight plugin that was built with efficiency in mind. Unlike other social sharing plugins, Social Pug will not slow down your website.

= Can I place the social share buttons only on posts and pages? =

You can place both the inline social share buttons and the floating sidebar social sharing buttons on any custom post type that your WordPress installation has registered. You are not limited to only posts and pages.
